# Variables, if, else, while

This project covers the basics of variables, conditional statements, and loops in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and usage of variables
- Learn how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- Implement `while` loops for repeated execution of code blocks
- Practice writing clean and efficient C code

## Project Structure

- **0-positive_or_negative.c**: A program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **1-last_digit.c**: A program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.
- **2-print_alphabet.c**: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **3-print_alphabets.c**: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- **4-print_alphabt.c**: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters `q` and `e`.
- **5-print_numbers.c**: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`.
- **6-print_numberz.c**: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, using only `putchar`.
- **7-print_tebahpla.c**: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- **8-print_base16.c**: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- **9-print_comb.c**: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

## Usage

To compile any of the programs, use `gcc` followed by the file name. For example:
```sh
gcc 0-positive_or_negative.c -o positive_or_negative
./positive_or_negative
```
