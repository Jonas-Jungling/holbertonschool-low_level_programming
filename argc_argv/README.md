# Project: argc_argv

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on understanding and using command-line arguments in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to use `argc` and `argv` to handle command-line arguments.
- Learn how to manipulate and parse command-line inputs.
- Gain experience in writing programs that can accept and process user inputs from the command line.

## Files

- `0-whatsmyname.c`: A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
- `1-args.c`: A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
- `2-args.c`: A program that prints all arguments it receives.
- `3-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two numbers.
- `4-add.c`: A program that adds positive numbers.

## Usage

To compile and run any of the programs, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
./program_name [arguments]
```

Replace `program_name` with the desired output name and `source_file.c` with the corresponding source file.

## Example

```sh
gcc -o whatsmyname 0-whatsmyname.c
./whatsmyname
```
