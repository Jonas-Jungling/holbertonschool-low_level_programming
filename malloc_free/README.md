# malloc_free

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of dynamic memory allocation.
- Learn how to use `malloc` to allocate memory.
- Learn how to use `free` to deallocate memory.
- Avoid common pitfalls such as memory leaks and double freeing.

## Files

- `0-create_array.c`: Function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- `1-strdup.c`: Function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
- `2-str_concat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings.
- `3-alloc_grid.c`: Function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers.
- `4-free_grid.c`: Function that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by `alloc_grid`.

## Usage

To compile the code, use the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output>
```

Replace `<filename.c>` with the name of the source file and `<output>` with the desired output file name.
