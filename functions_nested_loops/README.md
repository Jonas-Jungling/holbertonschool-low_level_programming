# Functions and Nested Loops

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on understanding and implementing functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose of functions
- Learn how to create and use functions
- Understand the concept of nested loops
- Learn how to use nested loops in C

## Project Structure

- `0-putchar.c`: A program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
- `1-alphabet.c`: A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `3-islower.c`: A function that checks for lowercase character.
- `4-isalpha.c`: A function that checks for alphabetic character.
- `5-sign.c`: A function that prints the sign of a number.
- `6-abs.c`: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- `7-print_last_digit.c`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
- `8-24_hours.c`: A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- `9-times_table.c`: A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- `10-add.c`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-print_to_98.c`: A function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

## Usage

To compile any of the programs, use `gcc`:

```sh
gcc -o output_name source_file.c
```

Then run the compiled program:

```sh
./output_name
```
