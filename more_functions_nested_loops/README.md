# More Functions and Nested Loops

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on more advanced usage of functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply nested loops.
- Use functions to organize code.
- Understand the scope of variables.
- Learn about header files and how to use them.

## Project Structure

- `0-isupper.c`: Checks for uppercase character.
- `1-isdigit.c`: Checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- `2-mul.c`: Multiplies two integers.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: Prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Prints the numbers from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4.
- `5-more_numbers.c`: Prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.
- `6-print_line.c`: Draws a straight line in the terminal.
- `7-print_diagonal.c`: Draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
- `8-print_square.c`: Prints a square.
- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with Fizz for multiples of 3, Buzz for multiples of 5, and FizzBuzz for multiples of both.
- `10-print_triangle.c`: Prints a triangle.

## Usage

To compile any of the `.c` files, use `gcc`:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <outputname>
```

Run the compiled program:

```sh
./<outputname>
```
