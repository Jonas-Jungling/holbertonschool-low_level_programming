# Singly Linked Lists

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists in C.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of linked lists
- Learn how to create and manipulate singly linked lists
- Gain proficiency in memory allocation and management in C

## Project Structure

- `lists.h`: Header file containing the function prototypes and the definition of the `list_t` struct.
- `0-print_list.c`: Function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
- `1-list_len.c`: Function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- `2-add_node.c`: Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
- `3-add_node_end.c`: Function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
- `4-free_list.c`: Function that frees a `list_t` list.

## Usage

To compile the code, use the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o linked_lists
```

To run the program, use:

```sh
./linked_lists
```
