# Variadic Functions

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on variadic functions in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what variadic functions are
- Learn how to use `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros
- Implement variadic functions in C

## Files

- `0-sum_them_all.c`: Function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_strings.c`: Function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- `3-print_all.c`: Function that prints anything.

## Usage

To compile the files, use the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o variadic_functions
```
