# Recursion in C

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on understanding and implementing recursion in the C programming language.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of recursion.
- Learn how to implement recursive functions.
- Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using recursion.
- Solve problems using recursive techniques.

## Project Structure

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string followed by a new line.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
- `3-factorial.c`: Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: Function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: Function that returns the natural square root of a number.
- `6-is_prime_number.c`: Function that checks if a number is a prime number.
- `7-is_palindrome.c`: Function that checks if a string is a palindrome.

## Usage

To compile the code, use the `gcc` compiler:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output>
```

To run the compiled program:

```sh
./<output>
```
